    <p>CAN I SUBSTITUTE THIS INGREDIENT?</p>
</div>
<div class="p2">
    <p>I recommend using the specified ingredients listed in the recipe whenever possible for optimal results. <br></p>
    <p> I understand that you may have dietary restrictions or simply do not have a particular ingredient on hand, <br></p>
    <p>but please remember that by using a substitution, I cannot speak for how much this will change in the overall <br> </p>
    <p>taste or texture of the dish without further recipe testing.</p>

<div class="p1">
    <p>I TRIED ONE OF YOUR RECIPES BUT IT DID NOT TURN OUT. WHAT DID I DO WRONG?</p>
</div>
<div class="p2">
    <p>Please understand that it is very hard for me to specifically answer this question since I am not in the kitchen with you.  <br> </p>
   <p> That being said, I only share recipes that have been successful and well-tested in my own kitchen, but <br> </p>
    <p> I understand that failures and mishaps can happen. <br> </p>

    <br>
    <p>Instead of blaming the recipe, it is important to remember that many factors are at play here that may result in a failed <br></p>
    <p> outcome. But with a little bit more information, we can troubleshoot what went wrong to have a successful turnaround<br></p>
    <p>next time.<br> </p>

<div class="p1">
    <p>WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO STORE LEFTOVERS? HOW LONG WILL THIS KEEP?</p>
</div>
<div class="p2">
    <p>As I am not an expert on food safety, I am not comfortable answering these questions. Methods for optimal food storage and <br></p>
    <p> shelf life should be based on good judgment and what you are personally comfortable with.<br></p>
