                    I recommend using the specified ingredients listed in the recipe whenever possible for optimal results.
                    I understand that you may have dietary restrictions or simply do not have a particular ingredient on hand,
                    but please remember that by using a substitution, I cannot speak for how much this will change in the overall
                    taste or texture of the dish without further recipe testing.

                    Please understand that it is very hard for me to specifically answer this question since I am not in the kitchen with you.  
                    That being said, I only share recipes that have been successful and well-tested in my own kitchen, but
                    I understand that failures and mishaps can happen. <br>
                    Instead of blaming the recipe, it is important to remember that many factors are at play here that may result in a failed
                    outcome. But with a little bit more information, we can troubleshoot what went wrong to have a successful turnaround next time.

                    As I am not an expert on food safety, I am not comfortable answering these questions. Methods for optimal food storage and
                    shelf life should be based on good judgment and what you are personally comfortable with.
