                <p class="indent-details">
                    3 large bunches fresh collard greens (about 4 1/2 pounds) <br>
                    2 tablespoons olive oil <br>
                    1 pound smoked turkey wings or legs, chopped into 1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces <br>
                    1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes <br>
                    1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar <br>
                    1/4 cup granulated sugar <br>
                    1 tablespoon garlic powder <br>

                <b>Step 1:</b>
                Rinse and dry the collard greens. Cut each leaf in half, removing and discarding the center rib. Stack a few leaves on top of each other, tightly roll together and thinly slice. Continue with the remaining leaves. Set aside.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 2:</b>
               Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until hot. Add the smoked turkey and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Add the sliced collard greens, vinegar, sugar, garlic powder and onion powder; season with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Stir to incorporate (a pair of tongs works great for this).    
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 3:</b>
               Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the greens are wilted, tender and darker in color, 30 to 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

                <b>Step 1:</b>

                <br><br>
                <b>Step 2:</b>
               Peel the potatoes and rinse them in cold water. Chop the potatoes in fourths. Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until fork tender, 20 to 25 minutes.    
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 3:</b>
               Drain the potatoes, and then return them to the pan. With the burner on low heat, mash the potatoes with a potato masher; the more steam that's released while you mash, the better. Mash for about 5 minutes. Turn off the burner. 
                <br><br>
                 <b>Step 4:</b>
               Add the butter, cream cheese, half-and-half, and seasonings. Stir to combine, and if the mixture needs thinning, add milk. Check the seasonings, adding salt and pepper, to taste.
               <br><br>
                <b>Step 5:</b>
                Pour the mashed potatoes into a large casserole pan. Dot the surface with butter. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for 10 more minutes. Serve immediately.

                <b>Step 1:</b>
                Separate the yolks from the whites of 3 of the eggs; set aside the whites. Add the remaining whole egg to the yolks.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 2:</b>
               In a saucepan, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in the whole egg and 3 yolks, and then stir in the milk. Cook uncovered, stirring often, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.

               Spread a thin layer of the pudding in a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Arrange a layer of vanilla wafers on top of the pudding. Thinly slice the bananas crosswise, about 1/8 inch thick, and arrange a layer of banana slices over the wafers.

                <b>Step 5:</b>
                To make the meringue, beat the reserved egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the whites will not slide out of the mixing bowl when it is tilted.

            <strong>Directions</strong>
            <p class="indent-details">
                <b>Step 1:</b>
                Heat 2 3/4 cups of the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot but not boiling. Whisk the granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup milk. Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, and then gradually whisk the egg mixture into the heated milk. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the peanut butter until melted. Transfer to a bowl and cool slightly, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming.                <br><br>
                <b>Step 2:</b>
               Meanwhile, place the pie crusts on a baking sheet or large platter. Place 2 teaspoons of the fruit jelly on the bottom of each pie crust. Smooth out slightly with the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula. Evenly divide the slightly cooled pudding among the pie crusts. Use the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula to spread the pudding to the edges of the pie crusts. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of each pie and chill until set, at least 4 hours.    
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 3:</b>
               Whip the heavy cream and confectioners' sugar in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer to medium to stiff peaks. Refrigerate until ready to use. 
                <br><br>
                 <b>Step 4:</b>
               To assemble, whisk the remaining fruit jelly with 2 teaspoons of water until smooth. Place a dollop of whipped cream on top of each pie, using the back of a spoon to create a small well in the center of the whipped cream. Spoon a small amount of jelly into the well and garnish with some roasted peanuts.
